# Zai's Config

## Overview
I've been using nvim for a while and have always used kickstart nvim. I decided to follow the Primeagens tutorial (0 to LSP) so that I can have a cleaner structure when adding plugins, etc.

## Features To Add
- GIF of Killua when starting nvim
- More keymaps
- More additions to fuzzy finder
